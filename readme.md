# Dataset :
We have build models using the dataset below: 
• https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017

This repository contains end-to-end tutorial-like code samples to help solve text classification problems using machine learning.

# Prerequisites:

*   [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
*   [Light Gradient boosting] (https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
*   [Logistic Regression] (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)
*   [Turicreate] 

# Modules:
We have one module for each step in the text classification workflow.

1. *Data Cleaning.ipynb* - Functions to load and clean data from different datasets. For each of the dataset we:

+ Read the required fields (texts and labels).
+ Do any pre-processing if required. For example, cleaning data (handling missing values, etc)


2. *LightGBM_Final.ipynb*  -- Prediction Model

+ Merges and joins to datasets
+ Extensive Feature Engineering to get optimal results of prediction
+ Split the data into training and validation sets
+ Build the model to predict if the customer will reorder or not
+ Calculated Metrics: F1_score, Precision, recall, ROC curve, AUC, Confusion Matrix

3. *Logistic Regression.ipynb*   -- Prediction Model

+ Merges and joins to datasets
+ Extensive Feature Engineering to get optimal results of prediction
+ Split the data into training and validation sets
+ Build the model to predict if the customer will reorder or not
+ Calculated Metrics: F1_score, Precision, recall, ROC curve, AUC, Confusion Matrix

4. *RecommendationModel.ipynb*  -- Recommendation Model

+ Create a utility matrix of user_product and their quantities
+ Normalized the data 
+ Train three models namely popularity, cosine, pearson using Turicreate 
+ Compare models based on precision, recall and RMSE Scores

3. *LUIGI* - Pipelining

+ The jupyter notebooks are actually an another representation of the pipelined code:
+ For pipelining, we have used Luigi package
+ Documentation: https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
+ Luigi folder has three 

   *datacleaning.py*  
+ This file has necessary user defined functions to load and clean the data. It outputs the cleaned data in the form of csv files.

   *featureengineering.py* 
+ This file has all the nessecary functions to preprocess the data before it could be passed to the model i.e. generating new features,    creating train and test data sets, etc.
+ The input to this file is the output of datacleaning.py file
